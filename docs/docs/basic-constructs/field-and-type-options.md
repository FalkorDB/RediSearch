Redis Stack provides various field types that allow you to store and search different kinds of data in your indexes. This documentation page explains the different available field types, their characteristics, and how they can be used effectively.

## Number Fields

Number fields are used to store non-textual, countable values. They can hold integer or floating-point values. Number fields are sortable, meaning you can perform range-based queries and retrieve documents based on specific numeric conditions. For example, you can search for documents with a price between a certain range or retrieve documents with a specific rating value.

## Geo Fields

Geo fields are used to store geographical coordinates such as longitude and latitude. They enable geospatial radius queries, allowing you to find documents within a specific distance from a given point. With the support for geo fields, you can implement location-based search functionality in your applications, such as finding nearby restaurants, stores, or any other points of interest.

## Vector Fields

Vector fields are floating-point vectors that are typically generated by external machine learning models. These vectors represent unstructured data such as text, images, or other complex features. Redis Stack allows you to search for similar vectors using vector similarity search algorithms like cosine similarity, Euclidean distance and inner product. This enables you to build advanced search applications, recommendation systems, or content similarity analysis.

## Tag Fields

Tag fields in are used to store textual data that represents a collection of data tags or labels. Tag fields are characterized by their low cardinality, meaning they typically have a limited number of distinct values. Unlike text fields, tag fields are stored as-is without tokenization or stemming. They are useful for organizing and categorizing data, making it easier to filter and retrieve documents based on specific tags.

## Text Fields

Text fields are specifically designed for storing human language text. When indexing text fields, Redis Stack performs several transformations to optimize search capabilities. The text is transformed to lowercase, allowing case-insensitive searches. The data is tokenized, meaning it is split into individual words or tokens, which enables efficient full-text search functionality. Text fields can be weighted to assign different levels of importance to specific fields during search operations. Additionally, text fields can be sorted based on their values, enabling sorting search results by relevance or other criteria.
